# Silksong Crest Build Maker
Hollow Knight: Silksong has collectibles called 'crests'. The player will have a crest equipped at all times, and each crest provides a different moveset and passive effect. Additionally, they all provide varying numbers of skill slots, red tool slots, blue tool slots, and yellow tool slots. Skills and tools provide the player character Hornet with different abilities. This system allows the player to be creative - equipping crests, skills and tools that lend well to their playstyle or combine together to create certain effects/synergies.

This project is an online crest builder, and aims to make the process of designing these builds quick and convenient.
